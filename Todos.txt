## IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS

### Phase 0: Foundation Skeleton ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Basic Pico-8 structure with station switching
**Status**: DONE
**What was built**:
- Created _init(), _update(), _draw() functions
- Added gamestate variable to track current station
- Implemented station switching (left/right arrows)
- 5 station placeholders: Bridge, Helm, Science, Power, Status
**Testing**: Press left/right arrows to cycle through all 5 stations
**Tokens**: ~50

---

### Phase 1: Resource Display System ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Show all game resources on Captain's Quarters screen
**Status**: DONE
**What was built**:
- Created resources table with 6 resource types
- money = 1000, food = 50, supplies = 20
- reactor = 100, o2_scrubbers = 100, reputation = 0
- Updated draw_status() with color-coded resource display
**Testing**: Navigate to Status station, see all resources
**Tokens**: ~80

---

### Phase 2: Time System & Resource Drain ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Make time pass and watch food decrease
**Status**: DONE
**What was built**:
- Added game_time, day_length (1800 frames = 60 sec), current_day
- Time increments in _update(), new day every 60 seconds
- Food decreases by 1 each day
- Day counter displayed on quarters screen
- Game over message when food = 0
**Testing**: Watch days increment, food decrease to 0
**Tokens**: ~60


---

### Phase 3: Helm Controls ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Manual controls for heading and speed
**Status**: DONE
**What was built**:
- Created sub table (x, y, heading, speed, depth)
- Implemented helm controls (left/right for heading, up/down for speed)
- Heading wraps at 0/360, speed clamped at 0-160
- Updated draw_helm() with heading, compass direction, speed, depth
- X button now switches stations (so arrows work for helm)
**Testing**: On helm, use arrows to adjust heading/speed
**Tokens**: ~100

---

### Phase 4: Submarine Movement 🔄 NEXT
**Goal**: Submarine actually moves based on helm settings
**What to build**:
- Convert heading/speed to velocity using cos/sin
- Update submarine position each frame
- Display position on status screen
**Testing**: Set heading/speed, watch position change
**Tokens**: ~80

---

### Phase 5: Bridge/Map Display ⏳ PENDING
**Goal**: Tactical map showing submarine position
**What to build**:
- Create draw_bridge() with map area
- Draw submarine as marker
- Draw port at (0,0)
- Draw sample site at (500, 300)
- Scale world coords to screen coords
**Testing**: See submarine move on map as helm changes
**Tokens**: ~120

---

### Phase 6: Waypoint System ⏳ PENDING
**Goal**: Click to set waypoint, submarine auto-navigates
**What to build**:
- Add cursor to bridge map (arrow keys move)
- Press X to place waypoint
- Auto-calculate heading to waypoint
- Arrival detection
**Testing**: Place waypoint, watch sub navigate to it
**Tokens**: ~150

---

### Phase 7: Sample Collection ⏳ PENDING
**Goal**: Collect samples at waypoint locations
**What to build**:
- Define sample_sites table
- Proximity detection to sites
- Press X to collect, increment supplies
- Mark sites as collected
**Testing**: Navigate to site, collect sample
**Tokens**: ~100

---

### Phase 8: Port Docking & Resupply ⏳ PENDING
**Goal**: Sell samples and buy food at port
**What to build**:
- Detect when at port (0,0)
- Port menu (sell sample, buy food, undock)
- Transaction logic
**Testing**: Dock, sell samples, buy food
**Tokens**: ~150

---

### Phase 9: Mission Framework ⏳ PENDING
**Goal**: Accept and complete missions for rewards
**What to build**:
- Mission structure (objective, reward, progress)
- Accept mission at port
- Track progress
- Award rewards on completion
**Testing**: Complete mission, get reward
**Tokens**: ~120

---

### Phase 10: Polish & Balance ⏳ PENDING
**Goal**: Make the loop fun and well-tuned
**What to build**:
- Balance resource consumption rates
- Add feedback (messages, pauses)
- Title screen
- Controls help screen
- Optional sound effects
**Testing**: Play complete loop multiple times
**Tokens**: ~100

---

## TOKEN BUDGET

Phase 0: 50 tokens (COMPLETE)
Phases 1-10: ~1060 tokens remaining
TOTAL: ~1110 tokens (~3.5% of 32KB limit)

---

## PICO-8 KEY CONCEPTS

**The Three Sacred Functions**:
- _init() - Runs once at start
- _update() - Runs 30 times per second (logic)
- _draw() - Runs 30 times per second (display)

**Buttons**:
- btnp(5) = X button (pressed this frame)
- btn(5) = X button (held down)
- 0=left, 1=right, 2=up, 3=down, 4=O, 5=X

**Angles**:
- Pico-8 uses 0.0-1.0 for full circle (not 0-360)
- Convert: pico_angle = degrees / 360

**Colors**:
- 0=black, 6=light_gray, 7=white
- 8=red, 10=yellow, 11=green, 12=blue

## CURRENT STATUS

✅ Phase 0 complete - Multi-station skeleton working
✅ Phase 1 complete - Resource display system
✅ Phase 2 complete - Time system & resource drain
✅ Phase 3 complete - Helm controls
🔄 Next: Phase 4 - Submarine movement
📊 Progress: 4/11 phases complete (36%)

## NOTES

- Keep testing after each phase
- Run cart in Pico-8 with: load aquanova.p8 then run
- Check token count with Ctrl+P in editor
- Commit to git after each working phase
- Update README as features complete
