Aqua Nova Pico - Detailed Implementation Plan
Overview
Building a submarine strategy game for Pico-8 from scratch. Starting with a complete skeleton, then implementing one full gameplay loop: Port → Navigate → Collect Samples → Return → Resupply. Target File: aquanova.p8 Approach: Incremental development where each phase is runnable and testable. You're new to Pico-8, so each step includes explanations of Pico-8 concepts.
Minimum Viable Gameplay Loop
The Core Loop We're Building:
Start at port (0,0) with initial resources (1000 money, 50 food)
Accept mission: "Collect 3 samples"
Use Bridge station to plot waypoint to sample site
Use Helm station to set speed (submarine auto-navigates)
Time passes → food decreases daily
Arrive at waypoint → collect sample (press X)
Return to port (plot waypoint back to 0,0)
Dock at port → sell samples for money, buy food
Complete mission → earn reward + reputation
Repeat with new missions
Why This Loop?
Demonstrates all core mechanics (multi-station UI, resources, navigation, missions)
Every step is testable with visible progress
Sets foundation for future expansion
Achievable within Pico-8's constraints
Pico-8 Foundation Concepts
The Three Sacred Functions
function _init()
  -- Runs ONCE when game starts
  -- Initialize all variables and state
end

function _update()
  -- Runs 30 times per second
  -- Handle input, update game logic
end

function _draw()
  -- Runs 30 times per second (after _update)
  -- Clear screen and draw everything
end
Game State Pattern (Multi-Station System)
gamestate = "bridge"  -- Current active station

-- Switch stations with Tab or shoulder buttons
-- Each station has its own update/draw logic
Key Pico-8 Gotchas
Angles: Use 0.0-1.0 for full circle (not 0-360°). 0=right, 0.25=down, 0.5=left, 0.75=up
Buttons: btnp() = pressed this frame, btn() = held down. 0=left, 1=right, 2=up, 3=down, 4=O, 5=X
Coordinates: (0,0) = top-left, (127,127) = bottom-right
Token Limit: 32KB compressed - comments count too!
Implementation Phases (Step-by-Step)
Phase 0: Foundation (Skeleton) ⚡ START HERE
Goal: Basic Pico-8 structure with station switching What to Build:
Create _init(), _update(), _draw() functions
Add gamestate variable to track current station
Implement station switching (Tab key or buttons 4/5)
Draw placeholder text for each station:
"BRIDGE"
"HELM"
"SCIENCE"
"POWER"
"CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS"
How to Test:
Run cart, see "BRIDGE" on screen
Press Tab (or button 5), see "HELM"
Cycle through all 5 stations
Pico-8 Concepts: _init/_update/_draw lifecycle, cls(), print(), btnp(), game state Estimated Tokens: ~50
Phase 1: Resource Display (Captain's Quarters)
Goal: Show all game resources on screen What to Build:
Create resources table in _init():
money = 1000
food = 50
supplies = 20
reactor = 100 (percentage)
o2_scrubbers = 100 (percentage)
reputation = 0
Create draw_status() function
Display each resource with label, value, and color
Format: "MONEY: 1000" (color 10=yellow for money, 8=red for food, etc.)
How to Test:
Navigate to Captain's Quarters station
See all 6 resources displayed clearly
Values are readable and color-coded
Pico-8 Concepts: Tables, print(text, x, y, color), color palette (0-15) Estimated Tokens: ~80

Phase 2: Time System & Resource Drain
Goal: Make time pass and watch food decrease What to Build:
Add time tracking variables:
game_time = 0 (minutes elapsed)
day_length = 1440 (minutes in a day)
In _update(): increment game_time each frame (scale appropriately)
When game_time % day_length == 0: decrement food by 1
Display current day on status screen: DAY: + day number
Add game over check: if food <= 0, show "OUT OF FOOD - GAME OVER"
How to Test:
Watch day counter increase over time
See food decrease by 1 each new day
Let food reach 0, see game over message
Pico-8 Concepts: Modulo % for cyclic events, frame timing (30 fps), conditional logic Estimated Tokens: ~60
Phase 3: Helm Controls
Goal: Manual controls for heading and speed What to Build:
Create sub table in _init():
x = 0, y = 0 (position)
heading = 0 (degrees 0-360)
speed = 0 (knots 0-160)
depth = 0 (meters 0-1200, not used yet)
Create draw_helm() function
Display current heading, speed, depth with large text
Controls:
Left arrow: decrease heading by 15°
Right arrow: increase heading by 15°
Up arrow: increase speed by 10 knots
Down arrow: decrease speed by 10 knots
Wrap heading (0-360) and clamp speed (0-160)
How to Test:
Navigate to Helm station
Press left arrow → see "HEADING: 345"
Press up arrow → see "SPEED: 10"
Hold right, watch heading increment and wrap at 360
Hold down at speed 0, confirm it doesn't go negative
Pico-8 Concepts: btn() vs btnp(), value wrapping/clamping, numeric displays Estimated Tokens: ~100
Phase 4: Submarine Movement
Goal: Submarine actually moves based on helm settings What to Build:
In _update(): convert heading and speed to velocity
Convert degrees to Pico-8 angle: angle = heading / 360
Calculate dx = cos(angle) * speed * time_scale
Calculate dy = sin(angle) * speed * time_scale
Update sub.x += dx and sub.y += dy
Add appropriate time scaling (e.g., 1 frame = 1 game minute at speed 60)
Display submarine position on status screen: POS: x, y
How to Test:
Set heading to 90 (east), speed to 60
Watch X coordinate increase on status screen
Set heading to 0 (north), see Y coordinate decrease
Set speed to 0, confirm movement stops
Pico-8 Concepts: cos() and sin() for directional movement, Pico-8 angle system (0.0-1.0) Estimated Tokens: ~80
Phase 5: Bridge/Map Display
Goal: Tactical map showing submarine position What to Build:
Create draw_bridge() function
Draw map area (e.g., 96x96 pixel area centered on screen)
Draw submarine as a small circle or triangle
Draw port at (0,0) as a different colored square
Draw sample site at fixed location (e.g., 500, 300) as another marker
Scale world coordinates to screen coordinates:
If world is 2000x2000, map 100x100 pixel area
Screen point = (world coord / world size) * screen size
Display map coordinates at top
How to Test:
Navigate to Bridge
See submarine marker (should start at port location)
Switch to Helm, set speed and heading
Switch back to Bridge, watch submarine move on map
Confirm port and sample site are visible
Pico-8 Concepts: rect(), rectfill(), circfill(), pset(), coordinate transformation Estimated Tokens: ~120
Phase 6: Waypoint System
Goal: Click to set waypoint, submarine auto-navigates What to Build:
Add cursor to bridge map:
Arrow keys move cursor position
Draw cursor as crosshair or square outline
Add waypoint system:
Press X to place waypoint at cursor
Store waypoint coords: waypoint = {x = cursor_x, y = cursor_y, active = true}
Draw waypoint marker (different color)
Auto-navigation in _update():
If waypoint active, calculate desired heading to waypoint
Use atan2(dy, dx) to get angle to target
Gradually adjust sub.heading toward desired heading
Arrival detection:
Calculate distance to waypoint
If distance < 10, set waypoint.active = false
Show "ARRIVED AT WAYPOINT" message
How to Test:
On Bridge, move cursor to sample site location
Press X, see waypoint marker placed
Set speed on Helm (e.g., 80 knots)
Watch submarine automatically turn toward waypoint
Watch submarine approach and arrive
See arrival message
Pico-8 Concepts: Cursor tracking, atan2(dy, dx), distance formula sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2) Estimated Tokens: ~150
Phase 7: Sample Collection
Goal: Collect samples at waypoint locations What to Build:
Define sample sites as table:
sample_sites = {
  {x=500, y=300, collected=false},
  {x=-400, y=200, collected=false},
  {x=300, y=-500, collected=false}
}
In _update(): check if submarine is near any uncollected sample site
If near (distance < 20) and not collected:
Show "PRESS X TO COLLECT SAMPLE" on screen
If X pressed: increment resources.supplies, mark site as collected
Draw collected sites with different color (or don't draw them)
How to Test:
Navigate to sample site waypoint
Arrive, see "PRESS X TO COLLECT SAMPLE" prompt
Press X, watch supplies increase from 20 to 21
See "SAMPLE COLLECTED" message
Sample site marker disappears or changes color
Navigate to another site, repeat
Pico-8 Concepts: Tables of objects, proximity detection, state changes Estimated Tokens: ~100
Phase 8: Port Docking & Resupply
Goal: Sell samples and buy food at port What to Build:
In _update(): detect when submarine at port (distance to 0,0 < 50)
When at port, show "PRESS X TO DOCK" prompt
Create port menu state:
Menu options: "SELL SAMPLE: +$100", "BUY FOOD (10): -$50", "UNDOCK"
Arrow keys to select option
X to confirm selection
Implement transactions:
Sell sample: if supplies > 0, money += 100, supplies -= 1
Buy food: if money >= 50, money -= 50, food += 10
Undock: close menu, return to normal navigation
Show updated resource values in menu
How to Test:
Navigate back to port (waypoint to 0,0)
Arrive, see "PRESS X TO DOCK"
Press X, see port menu appear
Select "SELL SAMPLE", press X
See money increase by 100, supplies decrease by 1
Select "BUY FOOD", press X
See money decrease by 50, food increase by 10
Select "UNDOCK", return to map
Can navigate away and return
Pico-8Concepts: Menu state management, cursor selection, transaction logic, sub-states Estimated Tokens: ~150
Phase 9: Mission Framework
Goal: Accept and complete missions for rewards What to Build:
Create mission structure:
mission = {
  active = false,
  objective = "Collect 3 samples",
  target_samples = 3,
  samples_collected = 0,
  reward_money = 500,
  reward_rep = 1
}
Add "ACCEPT MISSION" option to port menu
Track progress:
When sample collected during active mission, increment mission.samples_collected
Display progress on status screen: "MISSION: 2/3 SAMPLES"
Check completion when docking:
If samples_collected >= target_samples, show "MISSION COMPLETE!"
Award reward_money and reward_rep
Reset mission for next one
Show mission details on Captain's Quarters station
How to Test:
Dock at port, accept mission "Collect 3 samples"
See mission on status screen
Collect 1 sample → see "1/3 SAMPLES"
Collect 2 more samples → see "3/3 SAMPLES"
Return to port, dock
See "MISSION COMPLETE! +$500 +1 REP"
Check resources: money increased, reputation increased
Can accept another mission
Pico-8 Concepts: Mission data structure, progress tracking, conditional rewards Estimated Tokens: ~120
Phase 10: Polish & Balance
Goal: Make the loop fun and well-tuned What to Build:
Balance resource consumption:
Adjust time scale so days pass at engaging rate
Tune food consumption (maybe 1 food per 2-3 days?)
Adjust prices (food cost, sample value)
Add feedback:
Brief pause/flash when collecting sample
Brief message when mission accepted/completed
Add simple title screen:
Show "AQUA NOVA PICO" and "PRESS X TO START"
Initialize game on X press
Add controls help screen:
Accessible from Captain's Quarters (press O button)
Show all controls: arrows, X, O, Tab
Optional: Add simple sound effects (if time/tokens permit)
Station switch: sfx(0)
Sample collected: sfx(1)
Mission complete: sfx(2)
How to Test:
Play complete loop multiple times
Verify pacing feels good (not too slow or too fast)
All actions have clear feedback
Controls are explained in-game
Title screen works
Can complete multiple missions in a row
Pico-8 Concepts: Game balance, title screen state, sfx() for sound Estimated Tokens: ~100

Critical Files
aquanova.p8 - Single Pico-8 cartridge containing all code, sprites, sounds, maps
Note: Pico-8 uses a self-contained .p8 file format. All code goes in the __lua__ section (currently just "hello world"). Other sections (__gfx__, __sfx__, etc.) can be edited in Pico-8's built-in editors and are optional for the core loop.
Development Workflow
Recommended Process
Edit code in external editor or Pico-8's built-in editor
Run cart in Pico-8 (press Ctrl+R or type run)
Test feature - verify it works as expected
Check tokens - press Ctrl+P in Pico-8 editor, look at token count
Commit to git after each working phase
Update README as features are completed
Pico-8 Commands
run or Ctrl+R - Run the current cart
save - Save changes to cart
reboot - Restart Pico-8
folder - Open cart folder in file explorer
Ctrl+P - Show token/character count in editor
Next Steps
Start with Phase 0: Foundation (Skeleton) ⚡ This creates the basic structure that everything else builds on. You'll have a working multi-station interface that you can tab through - proving the core architecture works before adding any complexity. After Phase 0 works, proceed through phases 1-10 in order. Each phase builds directly on the previous one and is independently testable.
